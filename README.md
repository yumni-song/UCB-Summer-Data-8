## 🌍 Project 1: World Population and Poverty

- **Goal:** Explore global trends in population, income, life expectancy, and poverty rates using Gapminder data.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Cleaned and joined tabular data.  
  - Created scatter plots, line charts, and time-series analyses.  
  - Analyzed correlations (GDP–Life Expectancy, Child Mortality–Income).  
- **Key Insight:** Global inequality is gradually decreasing, though Africa shows persistent disparities.

## 🎬 Project 2: Movie Classification

- **Goal:** Build a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier to predict movie genres (*comedy* vs. *thriller*) from screenplay word frequencies.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Converted text into numerical word-frequency features.  
  - Implemented and evaluated k-NN with different *k* values.  
  - Conducted error analysis for misclassifications.  
- **Key Insight:** Proper tuning of *k* balances bias and variance, achieving solid accuracy.
